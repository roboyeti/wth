## Donate!
Donations are very welcome and if you find this program helpful, please consider either leaving the
included, single thread miner setup enabled on WTH or throwing some coins my way.  If you want a
miner, pool, or staking sight integrated, donations also go a long way to convince me to
investigate if it is possible and spend the personal time adding something I don't need myself.
