# LibreHardwareMonitor

https://github.com/LibreHardwareMonitor/LibreHardwareMonitor/

The LibreHardwareMonitor provides a remote way to get live information on a windows machine's hardware.

WTH currently uses WMI to get at LHM's sensor data from WMI, mainly due to the fact that WMI is
used anyway to access more details about hardware, like GPUs, so might as well just keep using
WMI for sensor data.

WMI remote access does have to be enabled on each machine within a shell with admin privileges:
 #> powershell Enable-PSRemoting -Force

You will also need a valid user/password for WTH to call WMI with.  Both can be supplied via the WTH config, or optionally, if all systems use the same password,
you can leave it empty, which will prompt you for a password when you first startup WTH.  This is obviously less than ideal, either way, so
future work on this module will work on an SSL key access method that is more secure.

LHM, and it's predecessor, OHM, also have built in web servers that can be enables and opened for
remote access via:
 #> netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="ALLOW TCP PORT 8085 : Openhardware Web" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=8085

Using the following prefab config file contents, the web server will be auto started on run with the same port:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<configuration>
  <appSettings>
    <add key="listenerPort" value="8085" />
  </appSettings>
</configuration>

Again, WTH does not use this interface at this time, but we may add one, plus, it is cool and allows remote viewing, albiet in
possibly the worst JSON structure you have ever witnessed!
