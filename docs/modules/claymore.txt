# Claymore Miner (Untested)

I believe this is the same as Phoenix miner.  Please let us know if this does not work.

Find and edit the 'config.txt', with minimum config as follows:

-cdm 2
-cdmport 0.0.0.0:33433

Port number above can be whatever you want it to be, but it must then match what is specified in the WTH config.

Example WTH minimal config entry

  claymore_example:
    port: #
    coin: ETH
    api: claymore
    nodes:
      hostname1: ip_address1
      hostname2: ip_address2
      ...
      hostnameN: ip_addressN

See documentation on other options.
