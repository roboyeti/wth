Find and edit configuration file "nhqm.conf", with minimum config as follows:

"watchDogAPIAuth" : "your_private_api_key",
"watchDogAPIHost" : "0.0.0.0",
"watchDogAPIPort" : 18000,
"watchDogAPITimeout" : 2000,

Port number above can be whatever you want it to be, but it must then match what is specified in the WTH config.
