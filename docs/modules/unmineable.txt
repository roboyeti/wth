# Unmineable Pool

Unmineable is one of the most absentee companies I have had the displeasure to be a customer of.  If you choose
to use their service and you "mine" more than a couple different coins, enabling the unmineable module in WTH
will likely get your IP address black listed for no good reason.

While their API documents were available (before they were banned from Github), the documents said no more than
500 requests per minute, which is kind of absurdly large amount.  However, more than 12 calls within 30 seconds
will actually get you banned, and each coin to monitor with WITH require two calls, so 3 coins = 6 calls.

After myself and another developer of another project have attempted to contact them to resolve this issue
every way we could several times, we have heard nothing.  I was tempted to drop unmineable all together, but
instead offer a new way, via Tor socks proxy (or HTTP proxy if you want to add more work for yourself).

The following options can be added to unmineable module config:

# This is necessary
tor_socks: true

# Only necessary if you need to change the defaults
tor_host: <ip_address> - Default = 127.0.0.1
tor_port: <port#> - Default 9050

More documentation is available in the tor_socks_config file under the docs directory.
